1) Attempeted to code up an invisibility cloak. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgdoZFIFZs

2) Currently it works with a red cloth, buth you can change the threshold values so that it works for other colors. Red, Green, Turquouise, Blue, Yellow recommended.

3) Another method to do this could be object detection and tracking, but the size and shape of the cloak changes, so I didn't try that.

4) When you run the script, wait for ~3 seconds for it to scapture the background, and then bring in your colored cloth.

5) You might need to adjust the threshold values so it works with your lighting conditions.
